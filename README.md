map.cpp:
- Designed and implemented a C++ program to simulate a road network, utilizing classes for road connections and intersections, reading data from text files to populate the network.
- Developed functionality for users to navigate the simulated road network interactively, selecting starting positions and choosing roads to continue on.

gps.cpp:
- Designed and implemented a C++ program to create a map of road intersections and connections, reading data from text files.
- Utilized Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two intersections, providing detailed directions for navigation.
- Implemented a hash table to efficiently store and retrieve information about towns, including population, area, and geographical coordinates.
